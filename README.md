todo list:
~~1) Run test dataset on trained FFNN~~
~~2) Use umap to reduce dimensionnality of embeds (like before kmeans clustering)~~
~~3) Color embeds depending on label predicted and plot them (maybe do a fade depending on class probability ?)~~
~~4) save graphs for qualitative comparison~~
5) make a quantitative comparison: precision, recall
5bis) test on all data
6) Clean code some more, try new datasets
7) Try some other techniques (encoder model + few shot inference ?)
