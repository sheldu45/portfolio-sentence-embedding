todo list:
~~1) Run test dataset on trained FFNN~~
~~2) Use umap to reduce dimensionnality of embeds (like before kmeans clustering)~~
~~3) Color embeds depending on label predicted and plot them (maybe do a fade depending on class probability ?)~~
~~4) save graphs for qualitative comparison~~
~~5) make a quantitative comparison: precision, recall~~
~~5bis) test on all data~~
5ter) Do precision and recall on kmeans results
5terter) Make hyperparameter check, check if quantitative comparison is working well as well
6) Clean code some more, try new datasets
7) Try some other techniques (encoder model + few shot inference ?)
